The GPS tracker system for intelligence tasks, consists of an autonomous device built with the objective of getting the localization of himself in real time, and sending it to a remote base, in order to keep the track of a vehicle. The device was conceived for his use in the Argentinian Coast Guard, and it was devised after a real problem.
The device was developed in the python and C++ programming languages and using the NUCLEO develop board from ARM, and it makes use of various IOT devices. This work is carried out within the framework of the Embedded Systems subject of the Faculty of Engineering of the University of Buenos Aires and in it the topics learned in the subject and in general in the Electronic Engineering career are applied; Such as OOP, general electronics, data communication, among others.
In these memories the work is presented, its planning and motivation, and the technical information about the hardware and firmware, as well as the explanation of its design and organization.
